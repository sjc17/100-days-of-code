# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 13, 2018
Taking on Kallaway's #100 Days Of Code. I had already planned on putting in the hours, so this is a nice place to log my progress and make a commitment.

**Today's Progress**: Finished off the Wikipedia Viewer project for freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** After hitting my head against the wall for at least 3 days now, I finally completed this project. I still haven't understood the importance of preventDefault() and why it made my code work, as well as the difference between JSON and JSONP (callback=?). I think I'll figure it out eventually. Also, I want to get to a point where I can do these projects in vanilla JavaScript, as jQuery feels like a crutch much of the time.

### Day 2: March 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started work on Twitch.tv API app. Most work today was making sure the API call worked and adjusting CSS.

**Thoughts**: It's a bit late to be learning CSS but I finally understand the box structure of it. I was worried about implementing the API functions because I had so much issues before, but it's been much easier this time around.

### Day 3: March 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made progress on HTML layout and implemented JS to generate the channel boxes. Once I figure out what to do with offline channels and implement the "All", "Online", and "Offline" buttons, all that will be left would be CSS formatting.

**Thoughts**: I made alright progress but did not work nearly as much as I would like to, mostly because of personal issues. Time to put in the hours starting this weekend.

### Day 4: March 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made JavaScript display all channels and whether they are streaming. Also implemented all, online, and offline buttons. All that is remaining is CSS to make the web page easier on the eyes.

**Thoughts**: I'm very satisfied with my work today, but now I feel like CSS3 has become my weak point. I think I'll give it a little extra time tomorrow before beginning the algorithm challenges in freeCodeCamp.

### Day 5: March 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on some algorithm challenges, including giving the sum of all numbers between two given numbers and giving the elements of two arrays that are only unique to one array.

**Thoughts**: I might need to do some reading on JavaScript since these challenges seem to require fundamentals.

### Day 6: March 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed a number of algorithm challenges requiring uses of regular expressions.

**Thoughts**: These challenges get easier the more I do them. One thing that I am trying to learn is to solve problems without resorting to nesting multiple for loops and if statements. Essentially, making my code solutions more elegant. Looking at other code campers' solutions and redoing the problems with these new ideas in mind is really improving my skills.

### Day 7: March 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Three more challenges completed. However, I have hit a wall with a challenge to find the least common multiple of a range of numbers.

**Thoughts**: I think there's nothing wrong with my solution's logic, but having it call functions within functions within a for loop causes it to take up so much time/resources that it's like there is an infinite loop. I'll need to take a second look to make sure that there's no infinite loop, but the code ran quite quickly when I wrote out every iteration of the loop manually so I doubt it.

### Day 8: March 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 6 more challenges down: arguments optional, telephone numbers, record collection, symmetric differences, exact change, inventory update,

**Thoughts**: Recursion, regular expressions, set theory, and general attention to detail were tested here. I should be able to finish these challenges and get started on the Advanced Front-End Projects by tomorrow at this rate.

### Day 9: March 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Only a single challenge done today, but it was a bit of a doozy. Currently stuck on understanding Javascript's Objects.

**Thoughts**: I really need to separate my work area from my play area, as I got very distracted today and didn't get as much done. Java and Javascript treat Objects a little more differently than I thought, so I will have to do some research tomorrow.

### Day 10: March 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed all the algorithm challenges now. Now building the JavaScript calculator.

**Thoughts**: This project has required significantly more planning than the websites that I've made previously. Most of my time will be spent on making a flowchart on paper tomorrow.

### Day 11: March 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Implemented number buttons and math operations. Still need to fix them.

**Thoughts**: Getting the behaviour exactly right for decimals and various edge cases is very tricky. I might need to scrap my code and start anew with more rigorous planning

### Day 12: March 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Rewrote code to be slightly more elegant.

**Thoughts**: Decimals is still not working. Might need to make code even more modular so that it can handle exceptions and edge cases well. Today was very busy so unfortunately I didn't get to put more than an hour on this project.

### **This challenge has been discontinued. I missed two days from re-evaluating my career situation and re-assessing the paths in life that I can take. Ultimately, web development/software engineering is still a career that I want to pursue, so I have begun a new challenge in the new (log.md)[log.md] file.**
