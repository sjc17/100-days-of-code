# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 13, 2018
Taking on Kallaway's #100 Days Of Code. I had already planned on putting in the hours, so this is a nice place to log my progress and make a commitment.

**Today's Progress**: Finished off the Wikipedia Viewer project for freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** After hitting my head against the wall for at least 3 days now, I finally completed this project. I still haven't understood the importance of preventDefault() and why it made my code work, as well as the difference between JSON and JSONP (callback=?). I think I'll figure it out eventually. Also, I want to get to a point where I can do these projects in vanilla JavaScript, as jQuery feels like a crutch much of the time.

### Day 2: March 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started work on Twitch.tv API app. Most work today was making sure the API call worked and adjusting CSS.

**Thoughts**: It's a bit late to be learning CSS but I finally understand the box structure of it. I was worried about implementing the API functions because I had so much issues before, but it's been much easier this time around.

### Day 3: March 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made progress on HTML layout and implemented JS to generate the channel boxes. Once I figure out what to do with offline channels and implement the "All", "Online", and "Offline" buttons, all that will be left would be CSS formatting.

**Thoughts**: I made alright progress but did not work nearly as much as I would like to, mostly because of personal issues. Time to put in the hours starting this weekend.

### Day 4: March 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made JavaScript display all channels and whether they are streaming. Also implemented all, online, and offline buttons. All that is remaining is CSS to make the web page easier on the eyes.

**Thoughts**: I'm very satisfied with my work today, but now I feel like CSS3 has become my weak point. I think I'll give it a little extra time tomorrow before beginning the algorithm challenges in freeCodeCamp.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
