# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 28, 2018
Second attempt at Kallaway's 100 Days of Code Challenge. Last attempt I had second thoughts about my career choices, but now I will give this my all.

**Today's Progress**: Finished off JavaScript calculator and began planning for the Pomodoro Clock project on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I finally found the last issue with my calculator: assigning *array1 = array2* makes both *array1* and *array2* reference the same array.
With that last little bug gone, the calculator works beautifully, with keyboard support included.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Finish planning pomodoro clock and make some progress. Polish off JavaScript calculator and make it pretty, and then make a new repo for it on GitHub.

**Hours Committed:** 2

### Day 2: March 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started and completed Pomodoro Timer and pushed code onto GitHub.

**Thoughts:** I'm really happy with my speedy progress so far. If tomorrow is anything like today, I will finish the entire Tic Tac Toe game then too, and potentially the entire front-end development curriculum by the end of the weekend!

**Plan for tomorrow:** Work on Tic Tac Toe game. Possibly polish older projects and push code onto GitHub to add to my current portfolio.

**Hours Committed:** 8

### Day 3: March 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made good progress on Tic Tac Toe. Also pushed pomodoro timer code onto GitHub.

**Thoughts:** Less time today than yesterday, but I've made decent progress. Hopefully I can get this done by tomorrow and the final project before Monday or Tuesday so that I can start learning React\.js/back-end things.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Finish Tic Tac Toe game, push code onto GitHub, and get started on Simon Game.

**Hours Committed:** 4

### Day 4: March 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tried to redo code for tic tac toe to implement a minimax algorithm, allowing the computer to compute the optimal decision each time. 

**Thoughts:** Read some discussions on implementing tic tac toe in Java and I might remake a lot of the code.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Continue to work on Tic Tac Toe.

**Hours Committed:** 3

### Day 5: April 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Eliminated minimax algorithm, replaced with hard-coded logic.

**Thoughts:** I had actually implemented the minimax algorithm successfully for the computer to search all decision trees and select the optimal one, but it took such a long time on each turn that I had to replace that AI with simpler functions which now work.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Add score, animations, CSS. Begin Simon project.

**Hours Committed:** 6

### Day 6: April 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Tic Tac Toe game (mainly CSS). Work was exhausting, so not too much in terms of productivity.

**Thoughts:** Overall the game was definitely a nontrivial exercise. I think it's easy to underestimate how much time really goes into even basic applications like this game, especially for people without a technical background. Even knowing what to expect, I felt that this was tougher than I thought.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Work on Simon Game

**Hours Committed:** 2

### Day 7: April 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created buttons in CSS using a single div element. Added audio for button presses.

**Thoughts:** I learned a lot in terms of CSS with this exercise. I'm still not sure about taking on a position for pure front-end web development - I will understand where I belong more once I've delved into the back-end curriculum.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Fix audio and button lighting on press.

**Hours Committed:** 5

### Day 7: April 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added reset button for new game and separated functions for clicking buttons from lighting them up.

**Thoughts:** I am using a lot of functions that reach into the global scope for their variables - I hope this practice won't kill me later in my career. For these projects it seems to be good enough.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Game functionality

**Hours Committed:** 2

### Day 8: April 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Began writing functionality for game state to progress (showing button presses, then waiting for user to press).

**Thoughts:** I will likely end up nesting several function calls for the game state. We will see if there's no performance drop. It was acceptable for the Tic Tac Toe project I completed earlier.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Game functionality

**Hours Committed:** 2

### Day 9: April 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed buttons to work for different browser sizes.

**Thoughts:** While I am happy with my progress, I wish it wouldn't happen in the last 5 minutes of the day. Though I guess this is part of the 80-20 rule: 80% of the rewards come from 20% of the time invested, or something of that sort.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Attend the Monthly Hack Day here in Edmonton and complete this Simon Game.

**Hours Committed:** 3

### Day 10: April 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Simon Game, and consequently the entire freeCodeCamp front-end development certification.

**Thoughts:** Today revealed to me the value of A) Finding a solid work environment to be productive and B) Networking and getting myself out there. I believe my plan from here will be to learn the corresponding back-end technologies and start getting more projects out there.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Start going through fCC back-end/Nodeschool.io and begin making my portfolio page.

**Hours Committed:** 4
