# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 25, 2018
Third attempt at Kallaway's 100 Days of Code Challenge. A lot has changed since I last attempted this, but now I know this is what I wanted to do all along. I started working in engineering but realized that was not my future, so I decided to make the switch earlier rather than later. This is not my first day coding since I made this decision, but it will be the first of my 100 days of coding challenge.

**Today's Progress**: Finished Object oriented programming/regular expressions/functional programming modules on freecodecamp's site.

**Thoughts:** The time commitment that is required is not the main issue I will have in the following days, but the mental capacity to keep going hours into my work each day. Still, it is a muscle that can and will be trained.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Start backend certification (again).

**Hours Committed:** 5
