# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 28, 2018
Second attempt at Kallaway's 100 Days of Code Challenge. Last attempt I had second thoughts about my career choices, but now I will give this my all.

**Today's Progress**: Finished off JavaScript calculator and began planning for the Pomodoro Clock project on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I finally found the last issue with my calculator: assigning *array1 = array2* makes both *array1* and *array2* reference the same array.
With that last little bug gone, the calculator works beautifully, with keyboard support included.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Finish planning pomodoro clock and make some progress. Polish off JavaScript calculator and make it pretty, and then make a new repo for it on GitHub.

**Hours Committed:** 2

### Day 2: March 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started and completed Pomodoro Timer and pushed code onto GitHub.

**Thoughts:** I'm really happy with my speedy progress so far. If tomorrow is anything like today, I will finish the entire Tic Tac Toe game then too, and potentially the entire front-end development curriculum by the end of the weekend!

**Plan for tomorrow:** Work on Tic Tac Toe game. Possibly polish older projects and push code onto GitHub to add to my current portfolio.

**Hours Committed:** 8

### Day 3: March 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made good progress on Tic Tac Toe. Also pushed pomodoro timer code onto GitHub.

**Thoughts:** Less time today than yesterday, but I've made decent progress. Hopefully I can get this done by tomorrow and the final project before Monday or Tuesday so that I can start learning React\.js/back-end things.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Finish Tic Tac Toe game, push code onto GitHub, and get started on Simon Game.

**Hours Committed:** 4

### Day 4: March 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tried to redo code for tic tac toe to implement a minimax algorithm, allowing the computer to compute the optimal decision each time. 

**Thoughts:** Read some discussions on implementing tic tac toe in Java and I might remake a lot of the code.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Continue to work on Tic Tac Toe.

**Hours Committed:** 3

### Day 5: April 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Eliminated minimax algorithm, replaced with hard-coded logic.

**Thoughts:** I had actually implemented the minimax algorithm successfully for the computer to search all decision trees and select the optimal one, but it took such a long time on each turn that I had to replace that AI with simpler functions which now work.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Add score, animations, CSS. Begin Simon project.

**Hours Committed:** 6

### Day 6: April 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Tic Tac Toe game (mainly CSS). Work was exhausting, so not too much in terms of productivity.

**Thoughts:** Overall the game was definitely a nontrivial exercise. I think it's easy to underestimate how much time really goes into even basic applications like this game, especially for people without a technical background. Even knowing what to expect, I felt that this was tougher than I thought.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Work on Simon Game

**Hours Committed:** 2
