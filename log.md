# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 28, 2018
Second attempt at Kallaway's 100 Days of Code Challenge. Last attempt I had second thoughts about my career choices, but now I will give this my all.

**Today's Progress**: Finished off JavaScript calculator and began planning for the Pomodoro Clock project on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I finally found the last issue with my calculator: assigning *array1 = array2* makes both *array1* and *array2* reference the same array.
With that last little bug gone, the calculator works beautifully, with keyboard support included.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Finish planning pomodoro clock and make some progress. Polish off JavaScript calculator and make it pretty, and then make a new repo for it on GitHub.

**Hours Committed:** 2

### Day 2: March 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started and completed Pomodoro Timer and pushed code onto GitHub.

**Thoughts:** I'm really happy with my speedy progress so far. If tomorrow is anything like today, I will finish the entire Tic Tac Toe game then too, and potentially the entire front-end development curriculum by the end of the weekend!

**Plan for tomorrow:** Work on Tic Tac Toe game. Possibly polish older projects and push code onto GitHub to add to my current portfolio.

**Hours Committed:** 8

### Day 3: March 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made good progress on Tic Tac Toe. Also pushed pomodoro timer code onto GitHub.

**Thoughts:** Less time today than yesterday, but I've made decent progress. Hopefully I can get this done by tomorrow and the final project before Monday or Tuesday so that I can start learning React\.js/back-end things.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Finish Tic Tac Toe game, push code onto GitHub, and get started on Simon Game.

**Hours Committed:** 4

### Day 4: March 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tried to redo code for tic tac toe to implement a minimax algorithm, allowing the computer to compute the optimal decision each time. 

**Thoughts:** Read some discussions on implementing tic tac toe in Java and I might remake a lot of the code.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Continue to work on Tic Tac Toe.

**Hours Committed:** 3

### Day 5: April 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Eliminated minimax algorithm, replaced with hard-coded logic.

**Thoughts:** I had actually implemented the minimax algorithm successfully for the computer to search all decision trees and select the optimal one, but it took such a long time on each turn that I had to replace that AI with simpler functions which now work.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Add score, animations, CSS. Begin Simon project.

**Hours Committed:** 6

### Day 6: April 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Tic Tac Toe game (mainly CSS). Work was exhausting, so not too much in terms of productivity.

**Thoughts:** Overall the game was definitely a nontrivial exercise. I think it's easy to underestimate how much time really goes into even basic applications like this game, especially for people without a technical background. Even knowing what to expect, I felt that this was tougher than I thought.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Work on Simon Game

**Hours Committed:** 2

### Day 7: April 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created buttons in CSS using a single div element. Added audio for button presses.

**Thoughts:** I learned a lot in terms of CSS with this exercise. I'm still not sure about taking on a position for pure front-end web development - I will understand where I belong more once I've delved into the back-end curriculum.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Fix audio and button lighting on press.

**Hours Committed:** 5

### Day 7: April 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added reset button for new game and separated functions for clicking buttons from lighting them up.

**Thoughts:** I am using a lot of functions that reach into the global scope for their variables - I hope this practice won't kill me later in my career. For these projects it seems to be good enough.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Game functionality

**Hours Committed:** 2

### Day 8: April 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Began writing functionality for game state to progress (showing button presses, then waiting for user to press).

**Thoughts:** I will likely end up nesting several function calls for the game state. We will see if there's no performance drop. It was acceptable for the Tic Tac Toe project I completed earlier.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Game functionality

**Hours Committed:** 2

### Day 9: April 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed buttons to work for different browser sizes.

**Thoughts:** While I am happy with my progress, I wish it wouldn't happen in the last 5 minutes of the day. Though I guess this is part of the 80-20 rule: 80% of the rewards come from 20% of the time invested, or something of that sort.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Attend the Monthly Hack Day here in Edmonton and complete this Simon Game.

**Hours Committed:** 3

### Day 10: April 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Simon Game, and consequently the entire freeCodeCamp front-end development certification.

**Thoughts:** Today revealed to me the value of A) Finding a solid work environment to be productive and B) Networking and getting myself out there. I believe my plan from here will be to learn the corresponding back-end technologies and start getting more projects out there.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Start going through fCC back-end/Nodeschool.io and begin making my portfolio page.

**Hours Committed:** 4

### Day 11: April 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through learning npm, beginning freeCodeCamp BackEnd Certification.

**Thoughts:** Something seems to be off with my development environment or Node/NPM installation because the how-to-npm module is not playing nicely at a lot of points. It's frustrating and I may skip parts of the tutorial if I can't make it work, at least for the moment.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Continue fCC backend

**Hours Committed:** 2

### Day 12: April 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learned npm and began learning Node through learnyounode.

**Thoughts:** It was fairly straightforward until hitting the parts on making modules. Working with callback functions is still confusing by a good amount, but I should be able to work through this within the day tomorrow.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Continue fCC backend

**Hours Committed:** 2

### Day 13: April 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Took a detour and began the Harvard course CS50 (Intro to Computing Science) and installed Ubuntu for dual boot on the PC.

**Thoughts:** Going back to the basics with C was fairly enjoyable. I plan on going through a week's worth of lectures and assignments for each day off of work to get through this course relatively quickly. I believe I need a stronger fundamental base of comp sci knowledge, since I don't have a comp sci degree. Hopefully this is an investment that pays well in the future.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Continue CS50, fCC backend.

**Hours Committed:** 4

### Day 14: April 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on CS50's problem set 2 a little

**Thoughts:** Today was very, very tiring at work. Did not have the willpower to do more than one hour.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Continue CS50, fCC backend.

**Hours Committed:** 1

### Day 15: April 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed problem set 2!

**Thoughts:** Relearning C and dealing with static typing was very interesting. Hopefully I can go through this introductory material quickly so that I can learn more in depth computing science concepts - especially algorithms.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Continue CS50.

**Hours Committed:** 4

### Day 16: April 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Viewed CS50 lecture week 2 and continued working through learnyounode on Node.js

**Thoughts:** I'm glad to be starting on the real computing science theory that CS50 has to offer like sorting algorithms and how to compare their performance, as well as big O/theta notation. It didn't involve any coding however, so my actual coding time was limited to learnyounode. I am getting a much clearer picture of what backend programming with Node.js looks like now, and I am excited to power through fCC's back-end portion like I did for the front-end.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Continue CS50, fCC backend.

**Hours Committed:** 2

### Day 17: April 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed learnyounode module on Nodejs

**Thoughts:** I'm not prioritizing my learning as much as I should, considering that I want to find employment sooner rather than later. I'll ramp up the hours committed starting from now!

**Plan for tomorrow:** Continue CS50, begin learning Express.js

**Hours Committed:** 2

### Day 18: April 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Express module on Nodejs

**Thoughts:** Backend development seems really exciting, and I'm finally piecing together the full picture for web development! Once I learn non-relational databases, it's time to begin developing APIs.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Continue CS50, begin learning MongoDB. Possibly begin Wesbos' Javascript30.

**Hours Committed:** 3

### Day 19: April 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on learnyoumongo, fCC backend.

**Thoughts:** Much too tired to do more than an hour. I ran into a ton of issues with the learnyoumongo module, and from what I've seen, all the "learnyou" modules are plagued with issues. Most of my time was spent researching/planning for some websites I will be making coming up.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Continue learnyoumongo

**Hours Committed:** 1

### Day 20: April 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tried continuing with learnyoumongo.

**Thoughts:** The learning module requires v2.2.3 of MongoDB, and we're already on 3.6. I'm not going to waste any more time with this module. Unlike the first 10 days, I've hardly made any progress! That will definitely change starting tomorrow. I might have to abandon learning the MEAN/MERN stack for now and focus on my projects now, with CS50 and Javascript30 to refine my fundamentals.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Continue CS50, possibly begin Wesbos' Javascript30. 

**Hours Committed:** 2

### Day 21: April 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Purchased domain name, got SSL protection up and running, and set up a Jekyll theme + made my basic website.

**Thoughts:** I finally have my website running! I think I will put my old projects in the projects section once I refactor the code and make them much prettier than they are now. Alternatively, I could just wait until I complete some bigger apps (CRUD apps, or React apps). Glad to have a finished product at the moment. Something that I learned is that there are a ton of themes available, and they all fill different roles (Blogging, Portfolio, Simplistic Landing Page). I think I will define my objectives clearly in the future so that I don't waste time trying out an option before deciding that it doesn't fit my needs.

**Plan for tomorrow:** Continue freeCodeCamp backend. Work on other projects (websites for friends).

**Hours Committed:** 8
