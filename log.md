# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 13, 2018
Taking on Kallaway's #100 Days Of Code. I had already planned on putting in the hours, so this is a nice place to log my progress and make a commitment.

**Today's Progress**: Finished off the Wikipedia Viewer project for freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** After hitting my head against the wall for at least 3 days now, I finally completed this project. I still haven't understood the importance of preventDefault() and why it made my code work, as well as the difference between JSON and JSONP (callback=?). I think I'll figure it out eventually. Also, I want to get to a point where I can do these projects in vanilla JavaScript, as jQuery feels like a crutch much of the time.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
